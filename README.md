# Web API Projects

## Overview
During the winter break of my junior year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I completed Codecademy's "Create a Front-End App with React" course to deepen my web development expertise. This repository contains two projects that I built using React, both interfacing with third-party APIs: the Spotify API ("Jamming") and the Yelp API ("Ravenous"). These projects served as capstone exercises that involved hands-on experience in integrating React with RESTful APIs and applying modern JavaScript features.

The projects utilize template code provided by Codecademy as part of their educational curriculum, and I followed the structured guidance provided in the course to implement these applications.

## Jamming - Spotify Playlist Manager

### Project Description
Jamming is a React-based web app that integrates with the Spotify API, allowing users to search for songs, create a custom playlist, and save it to their Spotify account. It demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and RESTful API requests. The app features a search bar where users can query the Spotify library and add songs to a playlist that they can rename and save.

### Features
- **Spotify Login:** Users authenticate via their Spotify account.
- **Search by Song, Album, or Artist:** Users input a search term to find tracks from Spotify.
- **Custom Playlists:** Users can add and remove tracks, change the playlist name, and save it directly to their Spotify account.

### Skills Gained
- RESTful API Integration
- Handling user authentication with the Spotify API
- State management in React applications
- Component-based architecture and modular development in React

### Technologies Used
- React for front-end development
- Spotify Web API for fetching and saving playlists
- JavaScript ES6+ for logic and interaction
- HTML/CSS for structure and styling

## Ravenous - Yelp Business Search

### Project Description
Ravenous is a Yelp-like app built with React that allows users to search for businesses in their area based on criteria such as "best match," "highest rated," or "most reviewed." Using Yelp's API, the app fetches business details based on user input and displays them on the UI.

### Features
- **Business Search:** Users can input search terms (e.g., "Pizza") and a location to get relevant Yelp results.
- **Sorting Options:** Users can sort results based on best match, rating, or review count.
- **Business Listings:** The app displays information about businesses, including their name, address, category, and customer reviews.

### Skills Gained
- API request and response handling in a React environment
- Building reusable components in React
- Utilizing asynchronous JavaScript (Promises) for API calls
- Implementing sorting and filtering options in a UI

### Technologies Used
- React for building the user interface
- Yelp Fusion API for retrieving business information
- JavaScript ES6+ for API interactions
- HTML/CSS for layout and styling

## Additional Skills and Courses
Along with these projects, I completed several courses to build my expertise in full-stack web development, such as:
